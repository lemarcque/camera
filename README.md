# camera
Android mobile application for taking pictures.

## Desription
I created this application for additional training before passing the android certification examen. The code source of this project is coded in Kotlin, the new languages supported by Android team for doing Android development which add more challenges to the task because i am freshly started finishing learning the basics.


Technical skills learned :
- How to to use the [Camera2](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/package-summary) API to get camera's device characteristic and taking pictures with.
- Apply my first Android mobile application written in _kotlin_ (previous was in Java since 2017)
